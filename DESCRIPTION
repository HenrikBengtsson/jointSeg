Description: Methods for fast segmentation of multivariate
    signals into piecewise constant profiles and a framework to generate realistic
    copy-number profiles. A typical application is the joint segmentation of total
    DNA copy numbers and allelic ratios obtained from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism
    (SNP) microarrays in cancer studies.
