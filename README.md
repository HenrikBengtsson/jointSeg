# jointSeg

This package implements functions to quickly segment multivariate signals into piecewise constant profiles and a framework to generate realistic copy-number profiles. A typical application is the joint segmentation of total DNA copy numbers and allelic ratios obtained from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) microarrays in cancer studies.

# Installation

The package can be installed from github:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mpierrejean/jointseg")
```

# Examples and descriptions
